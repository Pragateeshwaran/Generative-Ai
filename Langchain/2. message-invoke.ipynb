      "### Step 3: Create a main function to handle user input\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll create a main function that will ask the user for the numbers and the operation they want to perform. The main function will then call the corresponding function to perform the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Handle invalid user input\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll add some error handling to ensure that the user's input is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a high-level overview of what the code might look like:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The calculator will ask the user for two numbers and an operator (+, -, \\*, /)\n",
      "- The calculator will then perform the operation based on the operator chosen by the user\n",
      "- The calculator will display the result of the operation\n",
      "- If the user enters invalid input (e.g. a non-numeric value for a number), the calculator will display an error message\n",
      "\n",

      "3. **Implement the operations**: Write CUDA kernels to perform each of the mathematical operations. For example, you can create a kernel function for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
      "4. **Handle user input**: Write a host code that reads input numbers from the user and sends them to the CUDA device.\n",
      "5. **Launch the kernels**: Use CUDA's API to launch the kernels on the device, passing the input numbers and other necessary data.\n",
      "6. **Read the result**: Use CUDA's API to read the result from the device and print it to the console.\n",

      "- The kernel functions would be responsible for performing the mathematical operations on the input numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key concept here is that the kernel functions would run on the CUDA device, performing the calculations in parallel using multiple threads. The host code would manage the data transfer between the host and the device.\n",
